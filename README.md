# Word-Game-Solvers

This repository is a compilation of all of the word games I have solved thus far. I plan to solve many more in the future, including:

- Wordle
- Word Search (C++)
- Scrabble

The New York Times Spelling Bee game can be found here: https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee
The Word Connect solver is designed to solve a game on the app store called "Word Connect." 

Here are two links for the game Word Connect: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wordgame.words.connect&hl=en_US&gl=US, https://apps.apple.com/us/app/word-connect-%C2%A4/id1226926872

To compile these programs use g++ or another compiler. 
If you are using g++, run these commands:

- "g++ -O3 WordConnect.cpp -o WordConnectSolver"
- "./WordConnectSolver"
